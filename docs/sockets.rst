Platform and DUT sockets
========================

The following figure is a simplified drawing for the Scaffold v1.1 socket
footprints. It can be used to design custom daughter-boards.

Female HE10 connectors can be used on the daughter-boards. All holes are aligned
on a 2.54 mm (100 mil) grid, which is compatible with most of the prototyping
breadboards for very cheap daughter-board making.
